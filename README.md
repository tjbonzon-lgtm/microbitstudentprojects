# these are middle school student micro:bit projects while teaching Intro to Computer Science at LAMS Los Alamos Middle School, NM, with PLTW Project Lead the Way online course work 
# and their hands-on kits of inputs, outputs, micro:bit (from British Broadcast Corp) micro-controllers 
# as a collection of references for future students.
# and to celebrate and share what my students were able to code and create.
# course work was first introductory coding for inputs and outputs, and then creative projects like a security device and their choice of public art display (with lights and sounds),
# or assistive device for person or pet, or wearable device activated by the environment.
